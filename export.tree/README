# Essex EEG Movie Memory Dataset

Authors: Ana Matran-Fernandez and Sebastian Halder


### Description
This dataset contains raw electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded from 27 participants while watching 10-second long clips
extracted from movies that they had previously watched. For each clip, participants were asked whether they recognised the movie it belonged to,
and if so, whether they remembered having watched it previously or not.
If a participant reported recognising or remembering a clip, it was shown a second time to capture (via a mouse click) time annotations
of the instants that prompted this recognition.


### EEG
EEG data were acquired with a BioSemi ActiveTwo system with 64 electrodes positioned according to the international 10-20 system.
The sampling rate was 2048 Hz.


### Stimuli
The clips used in the study were originally annotated in terms of their memorability by Cohendet et al (see References).
This dataset can be requested from the authors.


### Example code
We have prepared an example script to demonstrate how to load the EEG data into Python using MNE and MNE-BIDS packages.
This script is located in the 'code' directory.
